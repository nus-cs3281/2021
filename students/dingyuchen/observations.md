### Project: CATcher

**CAT**cher is a desktop application for **C**rowd-sourced **A**nonymous **T**esting software. It uses GitHub as the backend for hosting bug reports.

This application will support the following order of workflow:
1. **Bug Reporting**: Testers will be informed of the teams they will be testing. Following which, they will be able to start creating new bug reports during this phase.
2. **Team's Response**: Teams will be able to respond to the bugs that are reported during the bug _reporting phase_.
3. **Tester's Response**: Testers will be able to respond to the team's acknowledgement / rejection of the bugs submitted.
3. **Evaluation**: Tutors and Admins will be able to view the bug reports and their respective teams' response. They can evaluate the responses, change the severity and status of the bug reports if needed.

### My Contributions

- As a foray into CATcher's code base, I took on a simple, open issue to make a method private. It helped me become exposed to Scuri and Jasmine, which are test frameworks used by CATcher

### My Observations

CATcher's usability seems to be very dependent on users not already having an existing `alpha` repo, which might cause problems if the onboarding flow breaks somewhere or if user like to make many repos

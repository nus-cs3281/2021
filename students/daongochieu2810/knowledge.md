### Angular

Aspects: Components, Templates, Directives, Dependency Injection
Source: Official Docs

### RxJs
- Learnt about ```concat``` and ```merge``` to call paginated API requests
- Learnt about ```catchError``` to handle errors without ending the stream of API requests allowing the FE to retry sending requests upon failures such as timeout

### Google App Engine

Aspects: Database access and modification, APIs, Cron jobs, Task Queue. 
Source: Teammates code base, Official Docs

### Java
- Learnt that high-level data structures should be prioritized over primitive ones to make the code more extendable e.g ArrayList should be used instead of array
- Revised best programming practices and OOP principles in Java 

### Objectify
- Learnt about server-side filtering feature

### Google Cloud Platform
- Learnt that parallelism might cause mutiple instances to be created and thus increase the cost
- Used Cloud Trace to find performance bottle-neck of API calls 

### Backend Techniques
- Paginatied API calls: break a huge request down into smaller requests. This allows for more data to be sent at the cost of additional performance overhead
- Created sripts to generate mock data and retrieve information about the database for the admin
